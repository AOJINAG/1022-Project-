## Project Summary

										
**Project Title: Mini-Database for definitions**

*App name: Cast Around*

Our project will be a mobile app that will display information related to a word inputted by a user. 

The app will contain a database storing a concoction of words that a user can view and access. Users will be allowed to select a term from the database or search for one they might want to know more about without paying any attention to capitalization. If the inputted word exists in our database, data such as definitions, synonyms, and images of the word, if possible, will appear on the screen in a display area. If a word entered does not exist in our database, the user shall receive an appropriate response. Our project will also feature a Stock Market side app.
