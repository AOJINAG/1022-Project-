## Project Summary

										
**Project Title: Mini-Database for definitions**

*App name: Cast Around*


Our project will be a mobile app that will display information related to a word inputted by a user. 

The app will contain a database storing a concoction of words that a user can view and access. Users will be allowed to select a term from the database or search for one they might want to know more about without paying any attention to capitalization. If the inputted word exists in our database, data such as definitions, synonyms, and images of the word, if possible, will appear on the screen in a display area. If a word entered does not exist in our database, the user shall receive an appropriate response. Users will also be able to filter their searches in alphabetical order, longest to shortest word, and shortest to longest word.


## Functional Requirements

•	Users can log in to our App using Android Studio and gain complete access to our Mini-database of definitions.

•	Users will be required to create an account or sign with an existing account in order to access the database and other features this app provides.

•	To create a new account, users can simply click on the *'Create Account'* button and follow the on-screen instructions to successfully register themselves. They will need to create a Username and thus a password for that account.

•	A username, between 6 and 30 characters, must be provided, and the password must not include symbols such as *@$%*&*.

•	Users can also choose to add any additional information that they may want to provide.

•	Existing users can directly access all the App's features by clicking on the *'Sign In'* button followed by entering their credentials.

•	Error messages will appear if a field entry is left blank or if inadequate information is stated.

•	The App will be operable on all major devices on Android Studio with a Minimum SDK Level/Version of Android 5.0 (Lollipop).

•	At the home page, users will have the choice to interact with our database to search for a word or access the Stock Market side app.

•	To search for a word, users can straightforwardly type the word they're looking for in the *Search bar* provided and their word will be looked up in the *Database of Definitions*.

•	Each Keyword in the database is hardcoded.

•	If a word is found in the database, information regarding that particular word will be displayed on a display screen. If a word is not found, a response stating that the word hasn't been found will appear.
